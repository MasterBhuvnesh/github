Git reset is a powerful command that allows you to undo changes in your Git repository. It can be used to reset the state of your repository to a previous commit, unstage changes, or even discard uncommitted changes.

This guide will walk you through the different modes of `git reset` and how to use them effectively.

## Why Reset?

The main reasons to use `git reset` include:

- **Unstaging Changes**: If you've added changes to the staging area but haven't committed them yet, you can use `git reset` to unstage those changes.
- **Discarding Changes**: If you want to discard changes in your working directory, you can use `git reset` to revert to a previous commit.
- **Rewriting History**: In some cases, you may want to rewrite commit history by resetting to a previous commit and making new changes.

## Types of Reset

There are three main types of `git reset`: `--soft`, `--mixed`, and `--hard`.

### 1. Soft Reset (`--soft`)

A soft reset moves the HEAD pointer to a previous commit but leaves your working directory and staging area unchanged. This means you can make new commits on top of the old ones.

```bash
git reset --soft <commit>
```

### 2. Mixed Reset (`--mixed`)

A mixed reset is the default mode. It moves the HEAD pointer to a previous commit and resets the staging area to match, but it leaves your working directory unchanged.

```bash
git reset --mixed <commit>
```

### 3. Hard Reset (`--hard`)

A hard reset moves the HEAD pointer to a previous commit and resets both the staging area and working directory to match. This means all changes will be lost.

```bash
git reset --hard <commit>
```

## Unstaging Changes

If you've added changes to the staging area but haven't committed them yet, you can use `git reset` to unstage those changes.

```bash
git reset <file>
```

This command will unstage the specified file, leaving your working directory unchanged.

## Discarding Changes

If you want to discard changes in your working directory, you can use `git reset` with the `--hard` option.

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD
```

This command will reset your working directory to the last committed state, discarding all uncommitted changes.

## Rewriting History

In some cases, you may want to rewrite commit history by resetting to a previous commit and making new changes.

```bash
git reset --soft <commit>
```

After this command, you can make new changes and create new commits on top of the old ones.


## Cleaning Untracked Files

In addition to `git reset`, you can use `git clean` to remove untracked files and directories from your working directory. This is useful when you want to clean up files that are not being tracked by Git.

### Removing Untracked Files (`-f`)

The `-f` (force) option is required to remove untracked files. Use the following command:
