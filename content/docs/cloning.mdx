# Cloning a Repository

**Cloning** a repository means creating a copy of a remote repository (like one on GitHub) onto your local machine.  
This allows you to work on the code locally, make changes, and push updates back to the remote repo.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Why Clone a Repository?

- To contribute to an existing project.
- To download and work on open-source code.
- To keep your local copy in sync with the remote repository.

---

## ðŸ”¹ How to Clone a Repository

### 1. Copy the Repository URL

- Go to the GitHub repository page.
- Click on the green **Code** button.
- Choose either **HTTPS** or **SSH** (HTTPS is easier for beginners).
- Copy the URL, e.g.:

```text
https://github.com/username/repo-name.git
```

---

### 2. Run the `git clone` Command

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want the project to be stored. Then run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git
```

This will create a folder named after the repository and download all of its contents.

---

### 3. Move Into the Cloned Repository

```bash
cd repo-name
```

Now youâ€™re inside the cloned project folder.

---

### 4. Verify Remote Connection

Check that your local repo is connected to the remote GitHub repo:

```bash
git remote -v
```

You should see something like:

```bash
origin  https://github.com/username/repo-name.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/username/repo-name.git (push)
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ What to Do After Cloning and Making Changes

Once youâ€™ve cloned the repo and modified some files, follow these steps to save and upload your changes:

### 1. Check Status

```bash
git status
```

- Shows which files were modified.

---

### 2. Add Changes to Staging

```bash
git add .
```

This stages **all modified files**.
(Or use `git add filename` to add specific files.)

---

### 3. Commit Your Changes

```bash
git commit -m "Describe your changes here"
```

ðŸ’¡ Always write a clear commit message explaining what you did.

---

### 4. Push Changes to GitHub

```bash
git push origin main
```

If the branch is `master` or something else, replace `main` accordingly.

---

- **Add â†’ Commit â†’ Push** â†’ The workflow to save and upload changes to GitHub.
