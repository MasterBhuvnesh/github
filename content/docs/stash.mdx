Imagine you're working on a new feature, but an urgent bug needs your immediate attention on another branch. Your current changes aren't ready for a commit. What do you do? This is where `git stash` comes to the rescue.

Git stash takes your uncommitted changes (both staged and unstaged), saves them away for later, and then reverts your working directory back to the last commit.

## Stashing Your Changes

To save your changes, run the following command. It's a good practice to add a message to remember what the stash is about.

```bash
git stash save "A descriptive message about your changes"
```

If you don't provide a message, Git will create one for you. A simple `git stash` also works.

```bash
git stash
```

This command saves your changes and gives you a clean working directory.

## Listing Stashes

To see all your stashed changes, use:

```bash
git stash list
```

This will show a list of your stashes. The most recent one is at the top (`stash@{0}`).

```
stash@{0}: On feature-branch: A descriptive message about your changes
stash@{1}: WIP on main: 5d82b1f Initial commit
```

## Getting Your Changes Back

When you're ready to continue where you left off, you have two main options to reapply your changes.

### Applying and Keeping the Stash

To apply the most recent stash and keep it in your stash list, use:

```bash
git stash apply
```

To apply a specific stash from the list, use its identifier:

```bash
git stash apply stash@{1}
```

### Applying and Removing the Stash (Most Common)

Usually, once you apply a stash, you don't need it anymore. The `pop` command applies the stash and then removes it from your list.

```bash
git stash pop
```

Like `apply`, you can `pop` a specific stash:

```bash
git stash pop stash@{1}
```

## Cleaning Up Stashes

If you've applied a stash with `git stash apply` and want to remove it, or you simply don't need a stash anymore, you can drop it.

To remove a specific stash:

```bash
git stash drop stash@{n}
```

Replace `n` with the stash number you want to remove.

To remove all stashes at once (use with caution!):

```bash
git stash clear
```
