# GitHub Features

GitHub is more than just a code hosting platform — it provides a set of powerful **collaboration and project management features**.  
Understanding these features helps teams organize work, discuss ideas, and automate workflows.

---

## 1. Issues

**GitHub Issues** are used to track tasks, bugs, feature requests, and improvements.  
They act like a lightweight **ticketing system** for your repository.

### Key Features:

- Title + description (supporting Markdown).
- Labels (categorize issues: `bug`, `enhancement`, `help wanted`).
- Milestones (group issues by project phase/release).
- Assignees (assign team members).
- Cross-linking between issues and PRs.

### Example workflow:

1. Create an issue for a new feature:  
   _“Add dark mode support”_.
2. Assign a developer and add labels.
3. Developer creates a PR that references the issue:

```

Fixes #12

```

→ When merged, the issue automatically closes.

---

## 2. Discussions

**GitHub Discussions** provide a space for **open-ended conversations** that don’t fit in Issues or PRs.

### Use cases:

- Q&A (community support).
- Brainstorming ideas.
- Sharing announcements.
- Best practices & documentation discussions.

### Features:

- Categories (Q&A, Ideas, General, Announcements).
- Upvotes for helpful answers.
- Mark accepted answers (in Q&A).

👉 Tip: Use **Discussions** for community talks and **Issues** for actionable tasks.

---

## 3. Pull Requests (PRs)

PRs are the main way to contribute changes.  
They let maintainers **review, discuss, and approve** code before merging.

- Supports inline code review & comments.
- Supports **checks** (CI/CD workflows, code linting, tests).
- Can be linked to Issues (closes automatically when merged).
- Supports **merge strategies**: merge commit, squash, rebase.

(See our detailed [Pull Requests & Forks guide](./pr_fork) for full workflow.)

---

## 4. Projects

**GitHub Projects** is a **Kanban-style project board** to organize work.

### Features:

- Columns: _To Do → In Progress → Done_.
- Link Issues & PRs directly to project cards.
- Custom fields (priority, size, status).
- Automations (move cards when PR is merged/issue closed).

👉 Use Projects for **agile workflows**, sprints, or roadmap planning.

---

## 5. Actions

**GitHub Actions** is GitHub’s **CI/CD platform**.  
It automates workflows directly in your repo using YAML files in `.github/workflows/`.

### Examples:

- Run tests on every PR.
- Deploy app to production when code is merged.
- Lint & format code automatically.
- Schedule cron jobs (daily builds, reminders).

```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml
name: Run Tests

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
test:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: 18
    - run: npm install
    - run: npm test
```

---

## 6. Wiki

**GitHub Wikis** allow you to write **long-form documentation** for your project.

- Each page is versioned with Git.
- Great for tutorials, architecture notes, FAQs.
- Supports Markdown.
- Separate from the main codebase but linked to the repo.

Use the Wiki for **detailed documentation**, and keep the `README.md` for project overview.

### Example: GitHub Wiki

For instance, the [AI-Lab Wiki](https://github.com/MasterBhuvnesh/AI-Lab/wiki) demonstrates how teams can organize documentation, tutorials, and guides in a dedicated space linked to their repository.  
Explore their Wiki for examples of structured project documentation.

---

## 7. Security & Insights

GitHub provides features to keep repos secure and track contributions:

- **Dependabot Alerts**: Alerts for vulnerable dependencies.
- **Code Scanning**: Automated static analysis.
- **Insights Tab**: Contribution graphs, community activity.
- **Branch Protection Rules**: Require PR reviews, tests to pass before merging.

---

## 8. Notifications

Stay updated with:

- **Watching** a repo → get all activity updates.
- **Custom notifications** → choose Issues, PRs, or Discussions only.
- **Email / Web / Mobile push** notifications.

---

## 9. GitHub Pages

You can host **static websites** directly from your GitHub repo.
Popular for project documentation, portfolios, and blogs.

- Source can be `main` branch or `docs/` folder.
- Works with Jekyll, Hugo, VitePress, or custom static sites.
- Free hosting with a `github.io` domain.

> For a step-by-step guide to setting up and customizing your site, see [GitHub Pages documentation](./github_pages).

# Summary

GitHub offers more than version control.

- **Issues** → track tasks/bugs.
- **Discussions** → open-ended conversations.
- **PRs** → propose and review changes.
- **Projects** → Kanban boards for workflow management.
- **Actions** → CI/CD automation.
- **Wiki** → long-form documentation.
