# Pull Requests & Forks

When working on **open-source projects** or collaborating with others on GitHub, two of the most important concepts are **Forks** and **Pull Requests (PRs)**.  
They allow developers to contribute safely to projects without directly modifying the original repository.

---

## What is a Fork?

A **fork** is your own copy of someone else’s repository.  
It lives in your GitHub account and allows you to freely experiment, make changes, and contribute without affecting the original project.

### Key Points About Forks:

- A fork is a **server-side copy** of the repository created on your GitHub account.
- It allows you to experiment without impacting the original repository.
- Once you’re ready with changes, you can propose them back to the original repository using a **Pull Request (PR)**.

---

## When to Use a Fork?

You typically fork a repository when:

1. You want to contribute to someone else’s project.
2. You don’t have write access to the original repository.
3. You want your own copy of the project to experiment with.

---

## How to Fork a Repository

1. Go to the repository page on GitHub.
2. Click the **Fork** button (top-right corner).
3. GitHub creates a copy of the repo under your account.

Example:

- Original repo: `github.com/original-owner/project`
- Your fork: `github.com/your-username/project`

---

## Cloning Your Fork Locally

After forking, clone the forked repo to your machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/project.git
cd project
```

Set the **upstream remote** to the original repository:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/project.git
```

Check your remotes:

```bash
git remote -v
```

You should see:

- `origin` → your fork
- `upstream` → the original repository

---

## Keeping Your Fork Updated

Since the original repository (upstream) may receive new commits, you should sync your fork:

```bash
# Fetch changes from upstream
git fetch upstream

# Switch to your local main branch
git checkout main

# Merge changes into your local main
git merge upstream/main
```

Push changes to your fork:

```bash
git push origin main
```

---

## Making Changes in Your Fork

> **Want to learn more about branching?**  
> We've covered that topic in detail—check out [Branching](/branching).

1. Create a new branch for your changes:

```bash
git checkout -b feature-branch
```

2. Make changes in the code and commit them:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Added a new feature"
```

3. Push the branch to your fork:

```bash
git push origin feature-branch
```

---

## What is a Pull Request (PR)?

A **Pull Request (PR)** is a way to propose changes from your fork (or branch) to the original repository.
It lets the maintainers review your code before merging.

### Key Points About PRs:

- PRs are opened on GitHub, not locally.
- They compare your branch (from your fork) with a branch in the original repo.
- PRs allow discussion, review, and approval before merging.

---

## How to Create a Pull Request

1. Push your branch to your fork (done earlier).
2. Go to the original repository on GitHub.
3. GitHub will prompt:
   _“Compare & pull request”_ → click it.
4. Add a title and description of your changes.
5. Submit the Pull Request.

---

## Pull Request Workflow

Here’s the typical workflow:

1. **Fork** the repository.
2. **Clone** your fork locally.
3. **Set upstream** to the original repository.
4. **Create a new branch** for your changes.
5. **Make changes** and commit them.
6. **Push** your branch to your fork.
7. **Open a PR** from your fork → original repository.
8. **Discuss & fix** (if maintainers request changes).
9. **PR gets merged** by the maintainers.

---

## Example

```bash
# Fork repo on GitHub
git clone https://github.com/your-username/project.git
cd project
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/project.git

# Sync fork
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main

# Work on a feature
git checkout -b feature-login
# (make changes)
git add .
git commit -m "Added login feature"
git push origin feature-login
```

Now open GitHub → Create Pull Request.

---

## After Pull Request is Merged

Once your PR is merged into the original repository:

- You can delete the branch you created in your fork (to keep things clean).
- Keep your fork updated regularly with the upstream repository.

```bash
git checkout main
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
```

---

# Summary

- **Fork** → Makes a copy of a repo under your account.
- **Pull Request** → Proposes your changes back to the original repo.
- **Workflow** → Fork → Clone → Branch → Commit → Push → PR → Merge.

This process is the backbone of **open-source collaboration**.
