## What is Git?

Git is a **version control system (VCS)** that helps developers track and manage changes in their code.  
With Git, you can:

- Save different versions of a project.
- Roll back to previous states if needed.
- Work together on the same project without conflicts.

Think of Git as a **“time machine + collaboration tool”** for code.

## What is GitHub?

**GitHub** is a **cloud-based platform** that hosts Git repositories.  
It adds collaboration and community features such as:

- Sharing and reviewing code.
- Managing projects with Issues & Project Boards.
- Submitting and merging changes through Pull Requests.
- Automating workflows using GitHub Actions.
