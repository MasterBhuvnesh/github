# Git Branching

Branches are one of the most powerful features of Git. They allow you to work on different features, fixes, or experiments in isolation, without affecting the main codebase.  
This sheet is a handy reference you can add to your repo or share with juniors during sessions.

---

## Listing Branches

```bash
# show local branches
git branch

# show local branches (explicit)
git branch --list

# show local + remote branches
git branch -a

# show branches with verbose info (tracking, latest commit)
git branch -vv
```

---

## Creating Branches

```bash
# create a new local branch (without switching)
git branch <new_branch>

# create a new branch and switch into it (old style)
git checkout -b <new_branch>

# create a new branch and switch into it (modern)
git switch -c <new_branch>
```

---

## Switching Branches

```bash
# switch into an existing branch (old style)
git checkout <branch>

# switch into an existing branch (modern)
git switch <branch>

# switch to the previous branch
git switch -

# detach HEAD (useful for exploring history)
git switch --detach <commit-ish>
```

---

## Creating a Branch from a Remote Branch

```bash
# create and track a remote branch locally (modern)
git switch -c <local_branch> origin/<remote_branch>

# older approach: create local tracking branch from remote
git checkout -b <local_branch> origin/<remote_branch>

# set upstream for an existing local branch
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/<remote_branch> <local_branch>
```

---

## Deleting Branches

```bash
# safe delete a local branch (prevents deleting unmerged changes)
git branch -d <branch>

# force delete a local branch (whether merged or not)
git branch -D <branch>

# delete a remote branch
git push <remote> --delete <branch>
```

> Note: `git branch -d` only affects local branches.

---

## Renaming Branches

```bash
# rename the current branch
git branch -m <new_name>

# rename a branch while you're on a different branch
git branch -m <old_name> <new_name>
```

---

## Working With Remote Branches & Syncing

```bash
# push a local branch to the remote repo (first push)
git push -u origin <branch>

# push a local branch to a remote (subsequent pushes)
git push origin <branch>

# fetch remote refs and updates
git fetch origin

# fetch and remove stale remote-tracking branches
git fetch --prune

# pull remote changes into current branch (merge)
git pull

# pull remote changes and rebase local commits on top
git pull --rebase
```

---

## Merging Branches

```bash
# switch to main
git checkout main
# or
git switch main

# merge another branch into main
git merge <other_branch>

# force a merge commit even if fast-forward is possible
git merge --no-ff <other_branch>
```

---

## Comparing Branches

```bash
# compare differences between two branches
git diff <branch_1> <branch_2>

# compare a single file between two branches
git diff <branch_1> <branch_2> -- <file>
```

---

## Resolving Remote-tracking / Tracking Branch Issues

```bash
# show remote details and tracking branches
git remote show origin

# set upstream branch for current branch (alternative)
git push -u origin <branch>

# if you accidentally pushed a branch with wrong upstream, reset upstream
git branch --unset-upstream
git branch --set-upstream-to origin/<branch>
```

---

## Working with Files: `git restore` (useful with branches)

```bash
# restore a file from another branch into your working tree
git restore --source <branch> -- <file>

# discard local changes to a file (restore from staged or HEAD)
git restore <file>
```

---

## Quick Tips

- Use `git branch -a` and `git branch -vv` to discover local, remote, and tracking information.
- Prefer `git switch` / `git switch -c` for creating and switching branches â€” it is clearer than `checkout`.
- Use `git fetch --prune` periodically to remove stale remote-tracking branches.
- Use `git pull --rebase` to keep a cleaner linear history on feature branches (team preference).
- Use descriptive branch names like `feat/login-button` or `fix/auth-bug` to make collaboration easier.
- When creating a branch to track a remote branch, use `git switch -c <local> origin/<remote>` or `git checkout -b <local> origin/<remote>`.
